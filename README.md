Drawable Optimizer
==================

Gradle plugin to optimize png files within an Android project.

## How it works ?

With this plugin you will be able to optimize the png files size inside your AndroidStudio project.
It works over the folder in which the resource merging was executed, by default in a Mac OSX system is `app\build\intermediates\res\merged`.

By doing this, all original png files are kept under /res folder and this optimization could be undone just cleaning the project.

In order to perform an optimization task, this plugin offers 2 different ways of file compression:

  * [Pngtastic] library, which brings its own compressor.
  * [Zopfli], which offers ridiculously good compression ratios in exchange of low compression speed.

## Why should I use this plugin ?

You can find an explanation from [Colt McAnlis] about why you should optimize your pngs [Reducing PNG file Size] and [Smaller PNGs, and Android’s AAPT tool]

## Usage

Just click on __Sync project with gradle files__ button

## Download & Installation

In `build.gradle`
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.fabiomsr:drawable-optimizer-gradle-plugin:1.0.3'
    }
}
```
And in `app\build.gradle`
```groovy
// Make sure this line comes *after* you apply the Android plugin (apply plugin: 'com.android.application')
apply plugin: 'org.fabiomsr.drawableoptimizer'
```
## Configuration
No configuration is needed by default, but if you want you can configure the following parameters.
Every time the configuration changes the project must be cleaned.

In `app\build.gradle`

```groovy
drawableOptimizer {
    optimizer = 'zopfli'
    compressionLevel = 9
    iterations = 15
    onlyOnRelease = true
    logLevel = 'info'
}
```
